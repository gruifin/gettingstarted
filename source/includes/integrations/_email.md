## Email

By default, all new Smooch apps will have an email channel enabled using the email address of the account owner.

When users send you a message using Smooch, you will receive an email at the configured address(es). This e-mail contains the user's message, device information, and any profile information about the user that you captured in your app. You can respond to your user's message by responding directly to the email.

### Getting help from your team

If you want multiple team members to respond to your Smooch requests, you can specify multiple email addresses, or use a mailing list. Whenever a team member replies, the incoming email address and associated name will be used to determine the team member displayed to the user alongside the message.
