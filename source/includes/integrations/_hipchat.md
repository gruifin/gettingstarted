## HipChat

HipChat is a team-based chat tool that helps to group all of your team's conversations and workflow into one beautiful, searchable place.

Smooch has a HipChat integration that allows your team to communicate with your app's users, without leaving HipChat.

We've also added some handy options to the context menu so that you can easily use Smooch's features directly within HipChat.
