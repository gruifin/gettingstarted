## Connecting to your CRM

Smooch's been designed to fit into your existing workflow so you can focus on speaking to your users and take advantage of whatever medium makes you most effective.

In addition to deep integration with <a href="#zendesk">Zendesk</a>, since Smooch uses e-mail to manage its communication, it's easy to use your favourite CRM to manage incoming conversations as tickets if you want to benefit from the additional tools this allows.

1. Take note of the e-mail address that the CRM uses to receive new support requests.

2. Set Smooch's forwarding address to the address you noted in step 1. 

3. Turn off any kind of signatures or annotations in your CRM to ensure that users receive a concise chat bubble when you reply.
