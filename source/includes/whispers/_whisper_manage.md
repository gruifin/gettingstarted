## Managing Whispers

![Manage Whispers](images/whisper_manage.png)

Once you've created a Whisper you can manage it from within the Smooch web interface. By clicking on the "Whispers" link in the navigation bar, you'll be presented with a list of Whispers as well as the number of users who have been exposed to them while running your app.

You can pause Whispers at any time. When you do so, the Whisper will not be shown to any more users until you mark it as active by clicking "Resume".
