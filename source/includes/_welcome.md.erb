Smooch lets you have rich conversations with your users, right in your app or on your website. If you want to learn more about Smooch, then visit our website at [http://smooch.io](http://smooch.io) or [sign up here](https://app.smooch.io). This page provides in-depth documentation on Smooch's features and is meant to be a guide for developers integrating the SDK and app makers seeking to engage with their users.

Source code examples are provided for all of our SDKs, including both Objective-C and Swift for iOS. You can view code examples inline, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top left.
