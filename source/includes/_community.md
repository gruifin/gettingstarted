# Building a local community

This section will tell you all about building a community.

Team
Having a team makes setting up your gateways much easier and more fun. Therefore I strongly recommend finding a few people that share your passion and can help setting up and managing your gateways.

As soon as you have set up your team, let me know so I can set you up with a campaign page (e.g. http://thethingsnetwork.org/c/buenosaires) and category on the forum. This will help you gather traction with sponsors and government.

Hardware
There is a lot of LoRaWAN hardware out there. Here is a short overview, with specifications: http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Hardware/OverviewGateways for gateways and http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Hardware/OverviewNodes for nodes.

The cheapest option is hardware we provide via a Kickstarter: kickstarter.com/projects/419277966/the-things-network Many teams order an other gateway for testing, setting up the network and find partners, as a proof of concept. For the final network they order hardware from the Kickstarter, which is cheaper and plug & play.

Connecting to TTN
Without a connection to the network, your hardware is just a box with blinking lights. This page will get you started: http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/Software/Overview

General information
A lot of information on the different aspects can be found on our wiki http://thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/

If your answer is not on it (yet), please consult the forum and post your questions: http://forum.thethingsnetwork.org/.
