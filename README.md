# Smooch
*Beautifully simple in-app messaging*

This project hosts the documentation available at [http://docs.smooch.io/](http://docs.smooch.io/).

The docs provides in-depth information on Smooch’s features and is meant to be a guide for developers integrating the SDK and app makers seeking to engage with their users.

All source code examples are provided in Objective-C, Swift, and JavaScript! You can view code examples inline, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top left.

For more in-depth details on Smooch’s api check out our [API reference](http://docs.smooch.io/api/). The API reference documents every method and property available through Smooch. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us [here](mailto:help@smooch.io).

Smooch is an SDK that connects you to your users so you can communicate with them and build a killer app. If you want to learn more about Smooch, then visit [our website](https://smooch.io) or [sign up here](https://app.smooch.io/signup).
